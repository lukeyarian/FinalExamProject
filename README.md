I ended up commenting out some code that would be needed for the inital main activity to launch. After not looking at it for a while, the implementation got a bit messy and I couldn't get the app to start anymore.

## Notes

This app took an incredibly long time and I wasn't able to get it working properly in the end. I wrote a bunch of code but it was difficult to get this large of a program to get to the point where I can debug all of the code that occurs
later into the runtime of the app. Overall, I gave it my best shot. The sheer size of this app was very challenging.
